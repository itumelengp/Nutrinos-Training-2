                       <p>Going on holiday? Too busy to take your dog(s) to a vet for vaccinations or to give them a proper grooming?
                            Don't fear, Tumy's Dog Grooming, Vaccinations and Sitting has you covered. Our mobile van comes to your house 
                            to give them a good clean.  We collect your fluffy friends from your house to take them for their vaccinations.
                            We also take care of your pets while you are out on holiday or business, whatever the case may be.

                    <p>
                        We are a mobile/offsite dog grooming, vaccinations and sitting service. We offer a convenience of coming to your house
                        to collect the animals. The grooming happens right outside your house in a movile van. Once your pets are all cleaned 
                        they are brought right back into your house. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For vaccinations we come and collect your pets and take them to our vets or your preffered vet at your convenience.                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also provide a pet sitting service anytime you are unable to be with your pets for any reason.  We take your pets out of 
                        your hands and look after them at our offsite location. You just need to tell us when to come and fetch them and to bring 
                        them back at your convenience.
                    </p>

                        All you need to do is go on to our Services page, send us your details i.e dates and the services you require then we take 
                        of the rest. All bookings can be done anywhere and at anytime on our website.
