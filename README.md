Tumy's Dog Grooming, Vaccinations And Sitting Website

The website demonstrates how to create responsive websites to cater for different devices.  To do this, this website is created to offer services for dog grooming, vaccinations and sitting. The about page describes what services are offered. 

The home page displays a showcase which gives the users an overview of what the website is all about. It also has a demonstration for allowing the users to subscribe to the newsletter. This is just for demonstration purposes and the user cannot subscribe to the newsletter. It also has the validations done on the page to ensure that the user actually puts in the email address before attempting to subscribe.

The about page tells the user about the services offered at Tumy's, namely the Dog Grooming, Vaccinations And Sitting. Also tells the user where to go on the website to actually book a service.

The service page is where the user can actually book a service. The different services are displayed and the user is given the costs for each service. On the side the booking form is displayed to allow the user to capture his/her details and the service required.  The users details are validated to ensure that coherent information that can be used for an actual booking is captured. 

The site is just a demo so far, no actual booking can be made, it just demonstrated the concept of responsive web design where a site can be comfortably viewed on a mobile device and a bigger desktop device.
